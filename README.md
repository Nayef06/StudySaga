## Overview

**Study Saga** is a lightweight, single-file browser **idle/clicker** game designed to be playable offline. Click the animated **Study Orb** to earn *Knowledge*, buy generators, unlock upgrades, and **Prestige (‚ÄúGraduate‚Äù)** to earn **Caps** for permanent power-ups. Balanced for **hours of progression**, not one sitting.

- üåÄ **Study Orb** clicker with live ‚Äú+X/click‚Äù preview  
- üè´ **Campus scene** on the main page that visualizes what you‚Äôve bought  
- üß† **Pop Quiz** random events with instant payout & timed buff  
- üèÖ **Achievements** (+0.5% global each)  
- üéì **Prestige & Caps** with a **Next-Cap** progress bar and exact requirement  
- üõçÔ∏è **Cap Shop** (spend *unspent* Caps on permanent upgrades; +3%/Cap uses **Total Caps**, so spending doesn‚Äôt reduce it)  
- üíæ **Autosave**, **offline progress**, **export/import** (localStorage)  
- üåó Dark/Light themes; no external libraries

## Quick Start

1. Save the game file as **`study-saga.html`**.  
2. Open it in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).  
3. It autosaves every ~30s. Use **Settings ‚Üí Export/Import** to move saves.

> No build step. No server. Just open the file.

## Controls & UI

- **Click** the **Study Orb** to gain Knowledge (combos increase value).  
- **Shop**: buy generators; milestones at **25/50/100/150/200** double that building.  
- **Upgrades**: global, click, and per-building boosts.  
- **Prestige**: convert lifetime Knowledge into Caps; shows **Caps on Graduate now**.  
- **Cap Shop**: spend *unspent* Caps on permanent bonuses (price discounts, global mult, click mult, combo window, quiz strength, offline cap).  
- **Your Campus**: animated tiles represent owned buildings with count badges.  
- **Settings**: number notation, particles, mute, theme, export/import, hard reset.

---

## Balance & Progression

- **Caps formula:** `floor( sqrt(lifetimeKnowledge / 10,000,000) )`  
- **Per-Cap global bonus:** **+3%** per **Total Cap** (all-time, unaffected by spending)  
- **Cap Shop examples:**
  - Scholarly Endowment: **+10% global/level** (multiplicative)  
  - Tuition Grant: **~1.5% building price reduction/level** (multiplicative)  
  - Study Focus: **+25% click value/level**  
  - Combo Theory: **+5 max combo & +100ms window/level**  
  - Quiz Bowl: stronger/longer event buff  
  - Night School: offline cap +2h/level (base 12h, max 48h)

You can make the run faster/slower by changing:
- `BUILDINGS` ‚Üí `baseCost`, `costMult`, `baseProd`  
- Prestige divisor (default **1e7**) in `capsForPrestige()`  
- Milestones list `[25, 50, 100, 150, 200]`

---

## Saving, Importing, and Offline Progress

- **Autosave** every ~30s (localStorage key: `study-saga-save-v2`).  
- **Export/Import** in **Settings** (Base64 JSON).  
- **Offline** gains apply up to **12h**, extendable via **Night School** Cap Shop upgrade (max 48h).

## File Structure

Single file with embedded CSS/JS:

```
study-saga.html
‚îî‚îÄ <style>  // theme, Study Orb, campus scene, layout
‚îî‚îÄ <script> // game state, loops, upgrades, Cap Shop, UI rendering
```

No dependencies; everything runs client-side.

---

## Customizing / Modding

- **Reskin**: Replace the Study Orb emoji (üìò) or tune gradients in `.studyOrb`.  
- **Buildings**: Edit the `BUILDINGS` array (icon, name, cost, production).  
- **Cap Shop**: Extend `CAP_UPGRADES` with new permanent perks.  
- **Events**: Tune spawn rate and rewards in `maybeSpawnEvent()` and `clickEvent()`.

---

## Known Limits

- Save relies on **localStorage**; incognito or strict privacy settings may block it.  
- Balancing aims for hours-long runs; extreme idling may still push numbers very high.  
- No server syncing or multiplayer.

---

## FAQ

**Q: Does spending Caps reduce my +3%/Cap bonus?**  
A: No. **+3%/Cap** uses **Total Caps** (earned all-time). Spending affects only your **Unspent Caps**.

**Q: Can I move my save to another device?**  
A: Yes‚Äî**Export** on one device and **Import** the string on the other.

**Q: Can I add more buildings/themes/quests?**  
A: Yes. Everything is in one file‚Äîcopy, tweak, and reload.
